      <p class="w3-justify">Malaysia’s first phase of Movement Control Order (MCO) started in 18 March 2020. Due to unfavourable economic outlook ahead, investors have chosen to cash out the equities on hand to maintain high level of liquidity. Even before the MCO announcement, market has slowly started to reflect the impact of MCO. Starting from 12 March 2020, KLCI has declined 37.12 points from 1,419.43 to 1,382.31. KLCI has dropped for 6 consecutive trading days and reached 1,219.72 points on 19 March 2020. After reaching its 10-year low, market rebounded sharply to 1,303.28, incremental of 83.56 points. This big fluctuation might be a very good opportunities for short term traders as it was easy to earn shorter profit within the week. Thus, out of curiosity, I have did a simple analysis and the equities in Main Market on how much they have dropped in prices in this week. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">So, I have started to search for a website that provides full list of stocks in Main Market. After putting some effort, I managed to find this website that has a stock screener to help in listing out the listed companies in Main Market. I have chosen to put minimum as “0” and maximum as “100” on Dividend Yield field since it does not allow to leave blank. Then, a total of 558 companies is shown with their respective tickers, categories and basic information such as price, PE and etc.</p>

      <ol>There are few assumptions in doing this analysis:
        <li>52 Week Low price is assumed to be lowest price recorded on 19 March 2020.</li>
        <li>52 Week High price is assumed to be highest price recorded before 19 March 2020.</li>  
        <li>Market capitalization for each company is calculated using 52 Week low and 52 Week High price. </li>     
        <li>Weightage for each company in respective category is calculated to obtain he weighted return for each category.</li> 
        <li>Weighted return is calculated using weighted market capitalization of each company in respective category.</li> 
      </ol>
      <p class="w3-justify">The table shown is the result of the simple calculation. The weighted return is displayed by category. On top of that, there is a column also to show number of companies in each category according to the criteria set in the screener.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">From the table, we can see that Real Estate Investment Trust dropped the least compared to other category, which is -25.90%. The major player of REITs in this category are “KLCC”, “IGBREIT”, “PAVREIT” and “SUNREIT”, with weightage of 32%, 15%, 12% and 12% respectively. These 4 REITs allocated 71% of market capitalization in REIT category. As usual, the price of REITs does not fluctuate as much as other equities and they are known for “steady” stream of dividend income for investors. However, it is important to find out what type of the real estate and properties are included in each REITs so that the most suitable REIT(s) can be selected.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Besides, utilities category only dropped for 29.15% which is second lowest in the list. It seems like investors are confident in these equities since they are the necessities in our life. The top 2 companies in market capitalization for this category are “TENAGA” and “PETGAS”, with weightage of 52% and 24% respectively.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">On the other side, equities in Technology category has plunged the most, a weighted return of -55.33%. It means that by average, the equities in Technology category has lost more than 50% of their market capitalization in since their 52 week highest price. The major players in the category are “MYEG”, “INARI”, “VITROX”, “FRONTKN” and “MPI”. Unlike REITs and utilities, Technology players are distributed more evenly in weightage. The top 3 Technology companies only allocated for 45% of the category’s total market cap. Tech stocks are well known with their high PE as investors tend to believe that they have higher potential to grow. Their PE during the peak were really high compared to current PE. The remaining categories are hovering between -32% to -55% of weighted return, which means no category can be acted as a shelter during this bearish market. This is also to warn investors that never put all the eggs in one basket. Investing heavily in Technology equities and Property equitie                             s can cause a big loss more than 55%.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">So, is it true that high PE stock will decline more than the low PE stock? This may not be true all the time. This can be shown in a scatter plot. From the scatter plot, it clearly shows that there is no significant correlation between PE and weighted return, especially not during a bearish economy.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">In a nutshell, investing is all about value of the company. At critical time like now, it is always the best to go back to the fundamentals such as cash flow, revenue and future outlook. Short term gains are exciting, but investing is a long journey.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Disclaimer: This is not a buy sell call. It is subject to my personal opinion and own justification.</p>
